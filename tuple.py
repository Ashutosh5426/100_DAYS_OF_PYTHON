# Tuple is just like list the only difference is that the  tuple is immutable.
tup = (1, 5, 32, 32, 5, 99);
# print(tup);
# print(tup.count(32)); #Count the occurrence of 32.
# print(tup.index(32));
# print(tup.index(32, 3, 5)); #Find the index of 32 from index 3 to 5.
# print(len(tup)); #Length of the tuple.
